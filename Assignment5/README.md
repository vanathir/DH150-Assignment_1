## Scenario 1:
Bryce decides that his next trip will be to Mexico City in Mexico. He is interested in the culture there and wants to be able to put the Spanish that he learned in high school and college to use. He wants the entire process of booking the trip, including flights, hotels, and itenerary, to be done within 3 hours. He wants to go on this trip in March for about 7 days. In order to do this, Bryce will utilize the Contiki website to search up a pre-planned trip to Mexico City that will have an itenerary that suits his needs. 
> In order to plan this trip, Bryce first opens up his laptop and goes onto the Contiki website. While before, he was frustrated since he would have to plan the entire trip by himself, this new site allows him to easily find an itenerary that is suited to him. Since he knows he wants to go to Mexico , he types "Mexico " into the search bar to load all the possible upcoming trips. He finds that there is an option that will take him to 6 places over the course of 8 days, but he would very much rather focus on just one city for that entire duration. So, he goes back a page to explore the other options. He goes into the survey bar on the right side of the page and puts in all the information necessary. The options that load for him are exactly what he was looking forâ€“ an extended period of stay in Mexico City. After looking at the trip that was planned for him given this information, he decides to book it since airfare, hotels, and activities are all included in the package.

## Scenario 2:
Ming's oldest grandaughter's sixth birthday is coming up in 2 months, and so she would like to go and visit her for this special day. She wants to book the trip in advance in order to reduce the cost of the trip as much as possible. She would like to spend at least 2 weeks before her grandaugher's birthday with her and at least a week after, making the trip a total of 3 weeks. She wants the flight seats to be comfortable since she is starting to develop back problems, as well as a one-way flight so that she does not have to worry about transferring. To do this, she will utlize any travel website that will give her the most efficient flight possible for the timeframe she is hoping for.
> While Ming would normally have her children book the trip for her, this time she decides she wants to try it for herself. This new site makes it easy for her by helping her through the entire process. She goes onto the website and at first has difficulty understanding what the website is asking for. She is confused about what information she should list to plan her trip. However, after clicking on the help button at the top of the top of the page, all of Ming's questions are answered and she puts in the proper information. To her delight, a variety of trips come up! The information is not overwhelming because there are bullet points which highlight the strenghts and weaknesses of each option. After finding one that she likes, she books the trip all by herself.

## Scenario 3:
Kathleen has been assigned to go on a business trip to Atlanta, Georgia for a consulting conference. The company has only given her a week's notice, and so she must book the trip as soon as possible. Kathleen had already gone to this conference the year prior, but still finds that booking the trip is difficult because she does not remember what hotel she stayed at or flight she flew on. She wants the flight to be affordable and under the budget that her company gave her, so she does not mind how good the seat is. However, she would like a nice hotel room that is close to where the conference is being held for practicality. To do this, Kathleen will go onto the website to search up flights and hotels to see which one will be best for her urgency. 
> Kathleen goes onto the website and puts in the information necessary, such as when she needs to go on the trip, flight preferences, and hotel preferences. After the site registers this information, it recognizes that Kathleen went on a similar trip the year before and pulls up all of the information from that trip so that Kathleen can go ahead and book the same flight and hotel that she stayed at before. However, wanting to research some more and choose something cheaper, Kathleen looks at the other options. She clicks on the drop down button that allows her to arrange from least expensive to most expensive and finds that there is another flight that is cheaper, and hotel that is slightly more expensive but nicer than what she stayed at before. Since this is what she wants, she books this trip with ease due to the site being efficient. She is glad that this new site makes booking trips easy for her since she can now use that time more wisely.
