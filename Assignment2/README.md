# DH150 Assignment 2: Usability Testing

##1. The purpose of usability testing is to assess how accessible a site or app is for the user. There are seven metrics of usability that should be used in the design of site, and they include: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, memorability, usefulness, and accessibilty. With usability testing, the researcher is trying to see if these metrics are met successfully by the site or app. You would conduct a usability test of a site or app by collecting empirical data from actual people who are told to perform certain tasks on these sites or apps. As they go through performing the tasks, they are being recorded and think aloud whatever they are doing. This allows us to accurately assess their reactions. These are usually based on the findings of heuristic evaluations, which are conducted by about 3-5 experts. While heuristic evaluations are done by experts, usability tests are done by real people which gives us a better idea of how the general population would react to a certain site or app.

     As you can see, I am not shown in the frame very well. This is so that the focus can be on the user who is testing the site rather than me. In addition, despite having chosen a quite space, students walked in which is why there are certain times when you can hear overlapping voices. Also, the participant continously moved the laptop for her comfort, which is also why there were certain times when I was not clearly in the camera.
     
##4. What I learned during the pilot test is that it can be very frustrating not only for the user who is testing the site or app, but also the researcher, because sometimes you want to give them the answer as to how the task should be performed, but are unable to because the whole point of the test is for the user to figure out the tasks by themselves. In addition, you have to have a lot of patience because sometimes, the usability test can go on for a lot longer than you intended due to variables such as the participant taking longer, or slow internet. Things that went well was that the survey covered all the questions I wanted it to and the user was able to get a well-rounded overview of the entire site because I had her go to various areas. In addition, my participant did a good job of truly talking and thinking aloud, so I was able to understand what she was going through as she was performing the tasks. Things that did no go well is that the room that we were in became loud despite being a study room. Additionally, there were times when the wifi was an issue and caused the site to be slow. Also, the participant was clearly getting frustrated with the site at times and decided to quit on the tasks. While this told me a lot about the design of the site, it also would have been nice to know overall how long it took to actually complete all of the tasks. In the future, I will be sure to book a room that is completely silent so that there are no distracting background noises, and will ensure that I tell the participant to complete the tasks, even if it takes longer.
