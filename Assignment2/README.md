# DH150 Assignment 2: Usability Testing

##1. The purpose of usability testing is to assess how accessible a site or app is for the user. There are seven metrics of usability that should be used in the design of site, and they include: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, memorability, usefulness, and accessibilty. With usability testing, the researcher is trying to see if these metrics are met successfully by the site or app. You would conduct a usability test of a site or app by collecting empirical data from actual people who are told to perform certain tasks on these sites or apps. As they go through performing the tasks, they are being recorded and think aloud whatever they are doing. This allows us to accurately assess their reactions. These are usually based on the findings of heuristic evaluations, which are conducted by about 3-5 experts.
