# Activity 1: Heuristic Evaluation

## **DH150-Assignment_1 by Vanathi Ravikumar**

### Contiki Website

The first website that I have chosen to use for this assignment is the Contiki website. It is a travel website that is used by people from the ages of 18-35 all over the world to plan adventure trips. It has quickly shaped the way that young people plan vacations because it allows the user to choose a trip that is already preplanned by the agency itself. However, it still allows free time so that you can do things in the city that aren't offered by the agency. 

Here is a picture of the website as soon as you open it:

#### Information about the website for the first heuristic evalution
(https://www.contiki.com/us/en "Contiki's Homepage")

From just a first look at this website, I thought that it did a good job of covering all the aspects that it needed to. It has the company's logo in the top left corner, the company's phone number, as well as a search bar that asks the user where they want to go. However, the site is not aesthetically pleasing to look at and has too much going on which makes it difficult for the user to easily navigate the site. Additionally, some of the colors are clashing, and it is confusing to understand what the buttons on the left side of the page actually do. There is also too much information to scroll through on the website, and I think this can be improved. 

1. *Visibility of system status*
    - Definition: system should provide users visual feedback on the site and within a reasonable amount of time
    - Ex. status bar, what page the user is on/ how many pages they have left (if survey)
    - The example shown below is a survey page that is found in the Contiki website. It is not a very good example of the visibility of the system status because it is small, and does not necessarily show the user how much of the survey is left. It is also hard to navigate because it is only on the right side of the page and does not take up the bulk of the it. It seems bigger because I screenshotted it.

2. *Match between system and the real world*
    - Defintion: system should use language and concepts that are easy for the user to understand. Information should appear in a logical way
    - Ex. using real time rather than military time, left/right sign
    - The picture below is a good example of this because it includes a right arrow which simply means that more pictures will appear to the right.

3. *User control and freedom*
    - Definition: users should be free to navigate the site as they want to, but often choose the wrong functions. They should be able to leave in a simple manner
    - Ex. back to home button, exit buttons
    - After clicking the button on the left with the three lines, it opens up a page that allows you to go to various pages in the website itself. However, the website does a bad job of allowing user control and freedom because it is difficult to understand what page each of those links takes you to, and how to get back to the original page that you want to.

4. *Consistency and standards*
    - Definition: site should be filled with similar words and actions
    - Ex. location of return to home button should be in the same place, exit is always exit, see more is always see more
    - The website does a good job of this because the buttons in the left side of the website are always in the same area. Additionally, the status bar on top with the search bar and phone number of the company are in the same area every time as well.
    
5. *Error prevention*
    - Definition: good systems prevent problems from occurring in the first place
    - Ex. 404 shows the site is bad and that there is a problem
    - The example below shows how in the first image, there is an error, but it is not make it clear to the user what the exact problem is. In the second image, there is a prevention of this same error by telling the user how to correct their mistake. This is not in this website, but it is an example of it in general. This website prevents errors most of the time, the only trouble that occurs is when it tells you to wait as the page refreshes.

6. *Recognition rather than recall*
    - Definition: should minimize how much the user has to memorize by utilizing various objects and actions
    - Ex. home means home
    - This website does not do a good job of following this important design heuristic because it is hard to understand what each of the buttons means. Using a previous image, it is clear to see that there are so many buttons but with no clarity as to what they mean until you actually click on the button. For example, one would not know that the "#" button means "who we are" until they click on the button and it takes you to that page.

7. *Flexibility and efficiency of use*
    - Definition: site should be easy for the navigator to use, whether they are experienced or inexperienced 
    - Ex. buttons
    - The Contiki website does not do a good job of making sure the site is flexible and efficient to use because it is too crowded and has too much going on. As seen in the picture below, there are too many things on page: there is the survey to the right, the travel options in the middle, and a bar with various buttons on the left. Because of how many things are present on the page, it makes it difficult to navigate it and is clearly not as efficient as it could be.

8. *Aesthetic and minimalist design*
    - Defintion: site should only include relavent information, and should be nice and easy to look at
    - Ex. light colors and minimal words on the screen
    - Contiki is not very aesthetic to look at. There are too many words and pictures present on the page, and it is definitely not minimalistic. Not only this, but the page also had an advertisement towards the top which adds onto the clashiness of the web page, as seen below.
    ![Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 11 16 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623119/72322354-001c4d00-365b-11ea-8c1f-5992cb3b8b46.png)

9. *Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors*
    - Definition: errors that may pop up on the site should be expressed in plain language and easy for the user to understand what th problem is
    - Ex. internet connection warning, 404 error
    - While I was taking a look at the website, there were no errors that came up except for a time when it told me to wait as the results loaded. I was easily able to understand the problem because it was told to me very clearly. Below is an example of a 404 error image that is explained well to the user. 
    ![404 error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623119/71935866-c5974980-315c-11ea-8671-7dd19d136874.png)
     
10. *Help and documentation*
    - Definition: provide help and documentation, and it should be easy to navigate through the site
    - Ex. help page, faqs, search, chatbot
    - Contiki's website has a chat bar as well as FAQ page which allows the user to get through the site and have their questions answered in a timely manner. However, it was not designed well because the you had to go through various FAQ pages before you could even reach your question. It was a multi-step process to something that could have been done very simply, and thus was frustrating.

### Airbnb Website and App

The second website that I will be using for this activity is the Airbnb website/app. This is an online way for people to choose a short period of time to live at someone's estate rather than a hotel. It allows people to travel to another place but stay somewhere homey and welcoming in contrast to a hotel room. It is an extremely popular way for people to find places to stay, and has become widely popular over the past few years. Despite this, the website could apply UX heuristics better.

Here is a picture of the app when you first open it up:

And here is a picture of the website when you first open it up:

#### Information about the website for the second heuristic evalution
(https://www.airbnb.com "Airbnb's Homepage")

From the first look of the website and app, it seems like a very well put together design. However, once you put in your preferences such as: where you want to stay, when you want to stay, and how many adults and children there are, the site gets more complicated because it lists a bunch of options without much order. It is a lot to fit on one page which can make it overwhelming for the user. 

1. *Visibility of system status*
    - The Airbnb website has a survey page at the very beginning as soon as you open it up, because it asks you your preferences for where you want to stay and when, along with how many people. It is a good example of the visibility of system status because it is a short survey that is quick to finish but also effective in narrowing down your results for potential Airbnb's to stay at. 
    
2. *Match between system and the real world*
    - Similar to the Contiki website, the Airbnb website includes arrows over rows of pictures which make it easy for the user to move left and right and see various Airbnb's that are avaible. It is also clearly a match between the system and the real world because left means left while right means right.
