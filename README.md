# EasyTravel 
## DH150 UX Design, Vanathi Ravikumar

## What is EasyTravel? 
EasyTravel is a travel application that makes it easy for users of all backgrounds to plan a trip. Many websites and applications out there are far too complicated to use and difficult to understand. My novel ux design of the mobile application is aesthetic while simple and informative. This application is meant for the avid travel community, and to be used by people such as adventurers, working individuals who need to plan a business trip, and families trying to get to their loved ones. To offer efficiency as well as satisfaction is the purpose of this app, and I hope that the users will be able to navigate this site with ease to cut down the amount of time they spend planning a trip. 

## Clear design statement: 
I would like for this mobil application to contribute to the travel community in a positive way. While the individual will be planning their trip, the application will have available hotels, food, to do activities and flights ready so that users can access them quickly and plan a trip quickly. In addition, they will not have to spend outside time researching on what the best deals are because the website will cater to their interests as they use the site more and more. By combining aesthetic importance with efficiency, users will be sure to leave this app satisfied and with a great trip planned. 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
### Heuristic Evaluation
There are many sites today that are travel oriented but many are not efficient. So, I chose to focus on the travel community for this project, but more specifically on the travel website known as Contiki. I used Jakob Nielson's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design to identify the potential problems in the travel website. There are seven metrics of usability that should be used in the design of site, and they include: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, memorability, usefulness, and accessibilty. With usability testing, I was trying to see if these metrics are met successfully by the site, and found that it was not. 

I have provided a link below so that you can take a look at this process.

### Usability Testing
I conducted a usability test to see how efficient how a current travel website is. My participant was my friend who is a college student. She enjoys planning trips and organization, and so I thought she would be the perfect person to observe for this particular topic. I had her perform 3 tasks: Task 1 involved fining a preplanned trip to Africa, Task 2 involved learning more Contiki's mission, and Task 3 involved group bookings. She was not able to complete all the tasks and was quite frustrated throughout the process, which showed me there was a lot to be changed in the website. Here is a link:

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
In todayâ€™s working world, many people are given a limited amount of vacation time that they often have to fit into an already busy schedule. While that vacation time is meant to be a way for them to relax and escape the pressures that the working industry can naturally cause, often planning those trips itself adds to the pressure. Many travel apps today are extremely busy and provide an overload of information making it hard for users to figure out what is the best option for them. They are too complicated and overwhelm users with lots of information that is hard to break down. They usually end up spending valuable time researching all of the possible ways they could travel. If we were able to make it simple and formulate a trip that was ideal for the user by utilizing surveys, then it would make it easy for the user. Rather than being a simple process, it is a complicated one that takes users a long time to figure out. The main activity my project would support for the users is to make this process of booking a trip easy. I would like for it to be a relaxing and fun process for users so that they become excited for the vacation. I would like to input a preliminary survey to capture what the user is looking for, so that the options that will be listed for them are pre-planned trips with everything they would want to do. However, they could still have the option to make changes. I used participatory observation for this research.

Bryce decides that his next trip will be to Mexico City in Mexico. He is interested in the culture there and wants to be able to put the Spanish that he learned in high school and college to use. He wants the entire process of booking the trip, including flights, hotels, and itenerary, to be done within 3 hours. He wants to go on this trip in March for about 7 days. In order to do this, Bryce will utilize the Contiki website to search up a pre-planned trip to Mexico City that will have an itenerary that suits his needs. | ![journey map dh 150](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623119/74231209-e9c5d900-4c7a-11ea-8f95-f6f17bfcb85e.jpg)

Ming's oldest grandaughter's sixth birthday is coming up in 2 months, and so she would like to go and visit her for this special day. She wants to book the trip in advance in order to reduce the cost of the trip as much as possible. She would like to spend at least 2 weeks before her grandaugher's birthday with her and at least a week after, making the trip a total of 3 weeks. She wants the flight seats to be comfortable since she is starting to develop back problems, as well as a one-way flight so that she does not have to worry about transferring. To do this, she will utlize any travel website that will give her the most efficient flight possible for the timeframe she is hoping for. |  ![journey map dh 150 copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623119/74231731-175f5200-4c7c-11ea-968b-b77949a90148.jpg)

Kathleen has been assigned to go on a business trip to Atlanta, Georgia for a consulting conference. The company has only given her a week's notice, and so she must book the trip as soon as possible. Kathleen had already gone to this conference the year prior, but still finds that booking the trip is difficult because she does not remember what hotel she stayed at or flight she flew on. She wants the flight to be affordable and under the budget that her company gave her, so she does not mind how good the seat is. However, she would like a nice hotel room that is close to where the conference is being held for practicality. To do this, Kathleen will go onto the website to search up flights and hotels to see which one will be best for her urgency.  |  ![journey map dh 150 copy 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623119/74232354-770a2d00-4c7d-11ea-858f-5c04e67ca504.jpg)

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment07 + part of 08]
With this assignment, I explored how to create wireframes and how to explore color.

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment07)
For this assignment, I chose to construct my low fidelity prototype on the travel app that I am designing. I want it to be an app that creates a simple itinerary for users, based off of the preferences that they input into the app. For my low fidelity prototype, I included multiple screens that took the users through various options available on the site, including which language and country/region they wanted, where they wanted to travel to, and for how long they wanted to travel for. The person that I had test this low fidelity protoype was my dad, because he often travels a lot for his work. Since this relates to a persona I developed, I thought he would be a good person to test it. The three features that I wanted him to test were 1. going through the survey of the app, 2. changing the flight options that the app came up with, and 3. to save the overall trip. The purpose of this low fidelity prototype was to see whether my ideas for the app are well excuted, or whether I should make some changes to it for better usability.

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
This prototype of the traevl app showcases all the new features that I implemented. While the site itself is much simpler, it also has much more aesthetic quality, and the simple buttons make it easier for the user to understand how to navigate the site to get to where they want to go. By making this prototype, I have a much better understanding of what is difficult of users to do because I came across similar problems when I myself was testing the protoype. I built this prototype using Figma, and designed everything from scratch.

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
Throughout this process, I learned how difficult it is to make a website that caters to the needs of users, especially in the travel community. There are so many things to make note of, such as ensuring that hotels are accounted for, food, flights, and more. It is difficult to ensure that you are also accounting for the wide range of people that will be using your website, and so, this is why it is important to ensure that you are conducting usability tests and research so that you can cater to everyone, or at least your target audience. In going through the low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes, I learned how to use Figma and saw that my origina prototype actually did not do a good job of capturing everything that it had to. And so, with my high fidelity prototype, I had to add a lot of features to make sure that the site was as easy to use as possible.
