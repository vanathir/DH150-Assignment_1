# Activity 1: Heuristic Evaluation

### **DH150-Assignment_1 by Vanathi Ravikumar**

The first website that I have chosen to use for this assignment is the Contiki website. It is a travel website that is used by people from the ages of 18-35 all over the world to plan adventure trips. It has quickly shaped the way that young people plan vacations because it allows the user to choose a trip that is already preplanned by the agency itself. However, it still allows free time so that you can do things in the city that aren't offered by the agency. 

Here is a picture of the website as soon as you open it:

1. *Visibility of system status*
    - Definition: system should provide users visual feedback on the site and within a reasonable amount of time
    - Ex. status bar, what page the user is on/ how many pages they have left (if survey)
    - The example shown below is a survey page. It functions as a good survey page because it tells the users how much more they have left until completion and clearly states the directions of what to do.

2. *Match between system and the real world*
    - Defintion: system should use language and concepts that are easy for the user to understand. Information should appear in a logical way
    - Ex. using real time rather than military time, left/right sign
    - The buttons below are a good example of this because it includes up, down, left, and right buttons which are easy for users to understand.

3. *User control and freedom*
    - Definition: users should be free to navigate the site as they want to, but often choose the wrong functions. They should be able to leave in a simple manner
    - Ex. back to home button, exit buttons
    - The example below clearly provides users the ability to go back to the orginal page that they were on by showing them exactly how they got to where they are now, and by providing links to backtrack should they want to.

4. *Consistency and standards*
    - Definition: site should be filled with similar words and actions
    - Ex. location of return to home button should be in the same place, exit is always exit, see more is always see more
    - In the example below, the multiple pages are very similar and include the same bar at the top and below.

5. *Error prevention*
    - Definition: good systems prevent problems from occurring in the first place
    - Ex. 404 shows the site is bad and that there is a problem
    - The example below shows how in the first image, there is an error, but it is not make it clear to the user what the exact problem is. In the second image, there is a prevention of this same error by telling the user how to correct their mistake.

6. *Recognition rather than recall*
    - Definition: should minimize how much the user has to memorize by utilizing various objects and actions
    - Ex. home means home
    - In the example below, despite the arrow having two different designs, the user knows that clicking that button would mean to go back to the previous page because users know that a back arrow means this.

7. *Flexibility and efficiency of use*
    - Definition: site should be easy for the navigator to use, whether they are experienced or inexperienced 
    - Ex. buttons
    - The Spotify example below is very efficient because it only utilizes a few words, and has a single button that automatically takes the user to the page they are looking for.

8. *Aesthetic and minimalist design*
    - Defintion: site should only include relavent information, and should be nice and easy to look at
    - Ex. light colors and minimal words on the screen
    - This webpage is very simple and easy to understand. It is also nice to look at!

9. *Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors*
    - Definition: errors that may pop up on the site should be expressed in plain language and easy for the user to understand what th problem is
    - Ex. internet connection warning, 404 error
    - The example shown below is a picture of a 404 error that is quite common, and explains to the user what exactly the problem is.

10. *Help and documentation*
    - Definition: provide help and documentation, and it should be easy to navigate through the site
    - Ex. help page, faqs, search, chatbot
    - The example below show's Amazon's FAQs page which answers many questions that users may have
