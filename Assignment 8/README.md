# Easy Travel

## Brief Summary
> My project is intended to make traveling easier for users. In today's busy world, many of us simply do not have the time to sit down and plan a trip because it would take far too long. That valuable time can be spent with friends or family, or doing other important things. In using this app, it should take users a short amount of time to plan a trip because the application will automatically sort the best options depending on the city so that a user does not have to do it. The purpose of this prototyping phase is to create a near accurate depiction of what the application will look like in the end. As you can see, there are still a lot of blanks that I have to go back and add to in the application, but despite this, users can get a good idea of what the final prototype will look like. The process for this is to first create a low fidelity prototype that you can go back and edit and make more usable.

## List of Tasks
1. Search bar
2. Survey that generates a trip for the user
3. In depth San Francisco trip planning
  > Users can see what there is to do and what hotels are available to stay at
4. Forgot Password page
5. Create an account page
6. Users can go back to the previous page or home page whenever they wish

> I decided to go with these colors and this design because since this is the prototype for a travel app, I wanted to make sure that that was an adventurous but optimistic and bright color scheme running through the app, hence the constant use of yellow and green. When it came to each individual city, I started to make the background the actual city and made sure to note contrast so that all the words were seen clearly while also flowing with the background.

> While I do not have multiple prototypes, I did get feedback from users who tested my prototype. The main thing that I learned was to make the application as simple as possible so that the flow of the app is easy to understand. In addition, they all told me they liked the color scheme and the backgrounds, especially when it came to California, San Francisco, and the California Academy of Sciences.
