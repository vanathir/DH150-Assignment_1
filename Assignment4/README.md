###### Assignment 5

## Step 1:
- In today’s working world, many people are given a limited amount of vacation time that they often have to fit into an already busy schedule. While that vacation time is meant to be a way for them to relax and escape the pressures that the working industry can naturally cause, often planning those trips itself adds to the pressure. Many travel apps today are extremely busy and provide an overload of information making it hard for users to figure out what is the best option for them. Rather than being a simple process, it is a complicated one that takes users a long time to figure out. The main activity my project would support for the users is to make this process of booking a trip easy. I would like for it to be a relaxing and fun process for users so that they become excited for the vacation. I would like to input a preliminary survey to capture what the user is looking for, so that the options that will be listed for them are pre-planned trips with everything they would want to do. However, they could still have the option to make changes.
- The basic need involved for this activity of going on vacation is found in the self-actualization tier of Maslow’s hierarchy. Vacation is not a fundamental need; rather it is a creative and fun activity that allows people to experience something new and relax. You can only achieve this if you have achieved the tiers below it, such as physiological needs and safety.
- The traditional and current solutions to satisfy this problem of complicated travel bookings is to use a travel agent who is an expert at using travel websites and booking trips. However, often times the user has to pay the travel agent along with the entire price of the trip, and it is expensive. So, it is not a feasible solution for many. When it comes to solutions that people have to satisfy self-actualization, they often do things like donate to charity or volunteer. Because they have already achieved everything else that they could need in life, they decide to pay it back to others who pay not have those things. They also do things like participate in marathons or hike extensive mountain ranges!
- Limitations to booking travel trips that could possibly be improved with digital technology is to make the apps and websites for this purpose much more simple. Many travel websites are too complicated and overwhelm users with lots of information that is hard to break down. They usually end up spending valuable time researching all of the possible ways they could travel. If we were able to make it simple and formulate a trip that was ideal for the user by utilizing surveys, then it would make it easy for the user. By creating a trip for users that is ideal for them, the user will have something that is already well suited for them, without the hassle of having to spend lots of time researching on the side. They could use that extra time to perhaps spend with friends or family, or doing something they enjoy.

## Step 2:
- The characteristics of users who typically utilize travel websites and apps are adults looking to get away for a little bit, families who are going to go back their country to visit family, or even teenage kids who are looking to take a trip with their friends. They are usually over the ages of 18 and either in college or working.
- The users would usually conduct this activity in their home or a coffee shop since it is where they feel the most relaxed, ready, and focused to plan a trip.
- In order to complete this activity, users would have to have information for the people who are going on the trip. In addition, they need to know information about the budget and length of the trip.

## Step 3:
- I will interview with participatory observation.
