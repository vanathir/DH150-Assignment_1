# Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Brief Description
> For this assignment, I chose to construct my low fidelity prototype on the travel app that I am designing. I want it to be an app that creates a simple itinerary for users, based off of the preferences that they input into the app. For my low fidelity prototype, I included multiple screens that took the users through various options available on the site, including which language and country/region they wanted, where they wanted to travel to, and for how long they wanted to travel for. The person that I had test this low fidelity protoype was my dad, because he often travels a lot for his work. Since this relates to a persona I developed, I thought he would be a good person to test it. The three features that I wanted him to test were 1. going through the survey of the app, 2. changing the flight options that the app came up with, and 3. to save the overall trip. The purpose of this low fidelity prototype was to see whether my ideas for the app are well excuted, or whether I should make some changes to it for better usability. 

## List of tasks
> Some of the tasks that my prototype supported are: filling out the survey with basic information so that the application could generate a simple itinerary, changing the flight options for the trip, and saving the trip that is planned.

## Description
> Based on the feedback that I got from the user who was testing the low fidelity prototype, there are a few things I would change to the wireframes. The first problem that my user encountered was on the first screen of the page which shows all the countries that the app supports. My user did not understand whether they were to choose what country they want to travel to, or what country they are currently in right now. So, when revising the prototype, I would make it clear that the user should choose what country they are currently in, and that the main use of this choice is to determine what language the app will continue in. The second problem my user encountered was when it came to choosing a country within the continent that you wish to travel to. My user was confused about why the page looked similar to the previous one, and whether this was to determine what language the app would be in, or for what specific country they wanted to go to. In addition, they were unsure as to whether they could choose multiple countries. In the revision, I would make it clear that this is a different page to the previous one and that the intent is to choose the country that you would like to visit, not the language. In addition, I will make it clear that they can choose multiple options, but only up to 5. Last, the user was unsure how to approach the "rank in order of importance" page. They were not sure what the choices were and whether you are simply choosing your top six choices, or your first to sixth choice. In the revision, I will make sure to include multiple options, even beyond the 6 that you can choose, like comfort, affordability, adventure, so that as many options as possible are available. In addition, I think I will change it to simply choose the 6 most important things rather than to rank it from first to sixth. While the user was able to complete all 3 tasks, it took them longer than I intended for it to. This is because I did not develop the prototype as well as I should have. In my next revision, I will be sure to consider all the hardships that my dad experienced with it. Overall, I found that I had developed a good starting point, but there are still some changes to be made of the most optimal usability.
