# Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Brief Description
> For this assignment, I chose to construct my low fidelity prototype on the travel app that I am designing. I want it to be an app that creates a simple itinerary for users, based off of the preferences that they input into the app. For my low fidelity prototype, I included multiple screens that took the users through various options available on the site, including which language and country/region they wanted, where they wanted to travel to, and for how long they wanted to travel for. 

## List of tasks
> Some of the tasks that my prototype supported are: filling out the survey with basic information so that the application could generate a simple itinerary, changing the flight options for the trip, and saving the trip that is planned.
